# Multiagent-Pacman

This assignment is part of the Principles of AI course and focuses on implementing intelligent agents to control the iconic video game character, Pac-Man. In this assignment, you'll explore various search algorithms, including minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax, to develop agents capable of making strategic decisions in the maze.

### Assignment Overview
The assignment consists of several parts, each building upon the previous one. It starts with a basic Reflex Agent for Pac-Man and gradually progresses to more advanced agents that can handle various challenges in the game. Here's an overview of what the coding parts are:

**Part 1a:** Design a Reflex Agent: Create a basic agent for Pac-Man that uses reflex actions based on the game state.

**Part 1b:** Implement Minimax: Extend Pac-Man to become a minimax agent, considering the behavior of both Pac-Man and ghosts to make optimal decisions.

**Part 2a:** Introduce Alpha-Beta Pruning: Enhance the minimax agent with alpha-beta pruning to improve efficiency and reduce search space.

**Part 3b:** Develop an Expectimax Agent: In this part, Pac-Man will assume he is playing against multiple RandomGhosts who choose actions uniformly at random, and Pac-Man aims to maximize his expected utility.

**Extra Credit:** Create a Better Evaluation Function: As an extra credit challenge, you can develop a more sophisticated evaluation function to improve your agent's performance.
